// analysis_feed_test <mode> <fixtures> <tmpdir>: the waveform of an HTTP
// file decoded from mpv's cache (the cache feed) reads as a decode while the
// file downloads. b.flac (30 s, 3.7 MB) comes from slow_http.py at 600000
// bytes a second (run.sh), about 6 s for the file, with the cache on.
//   grow   waveform on: every snapshot before the end reads "decoding",
//          with the bins filled so far as its coverage, never shrinking,
//          and several of them partial; then "ready" with every bin filled,
//          and no GET after the player's own, so the pass was the feed's
//          (r18 reads the partials as "progressive", like an envelope that
//          grows from playback and never turns ready).
